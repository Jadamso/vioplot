##First submission

This is a new submission of this package, it is based on the existing vioplot (0.2) package but I am not the current maintainer.

Since this package has been orphaned since 2005 (12 years to date), I propose to take over as maintainer. I have continued to develop this a fork of this package under the repository: https://github.com/TomKellyGenetics/vioplotx

Additional features have been added with backwards-compatibility with vioplot 0.2 and added compatibility with formula inputs (as used for beanplot and boxplot).

## Test environments
* local elementary OS 0.4 (Ubuntu 16.04) install R 3.4.2
* local Windows 7 install, R 3.2.1
* local Mac OS (10.13.6) R 3.5.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.2
* Windows Server 2012 (on AppVeyor), R 3.4.3
* win-builder

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs

##NOTE

Maintainer differs as described above.

All other issues have been addressed, including those in the vioplot (0.2) release.
