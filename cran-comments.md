#NOTES

##First submission

This is my first submission of this package, although it is based on the existing vioplot (0.2) package. 

##Package size

Large directory is due to the lengthy Vignettes. These are essential to understanding the range of added features compared to vioplot 0.2.

##License

Deprecated License has been kept to conform with License of the orphaned vioplot (0.2) package released by Daniel Adler <dadler@uni-goettingen.de>. 

##attach

Is needed to process formula input. The input data is detached within the function.
