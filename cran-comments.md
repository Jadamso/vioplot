##First submission

This is a new submission of this package, it is based on the existing vioplot (0.2) package but I am not the current maintainer.

Since this package has been orphaned since 2005 (12 years to date), I propose to take over as maintainer. I have continued to develop this a fork of this package under the repository: https://github.com/TomKellyGenetics/vioplotx

Additional features have been added with backwards-compatibility with vioplot 0.2 and added compatibility with formula inputs (as used for beanplot and boxplot).

## Test environments

* local Windows 7 install, R 3.2.1
* local Mac OS (10.13.6) R 3.5.1
